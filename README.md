TodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project is able to offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of what a framework may be capable of.

It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.


## Getting Involved

Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.

Check out our [contribution docs](contributing.md) for more info.
